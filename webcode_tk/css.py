class Stylesheet:
    """A Stylesheet object with details about the sheet and its
    components.

    The stylesheet object has the full code, a list of comments from the
    stylesheet, a list of nested @rules, rulesets pertaining to colors,
    a list of all selectors, and information about repeated selectors.

    About repeated selectors, front-end developers should always employ
    the DRY principle: Don't Repeat Yourself. In other words, if you
    use a selector once in your stylesheet, the only other place you
    would logically put the same selector would be in a nested at-rule
    (in particular, an @media or @print breakpoint)

    For this reason, both the Stylesheet object and the NesteAtRule
    objects have attributes that show whether there are repeated
    selectors or not as well as which selectors get repeated.

    Attributes:
        href: the filename (not path), which may end with .css or .html
            (if stylesheet object comes from a style tag).
        text: the actual code itself of the entire file or style tag.
        type: whether it's a file or local if it's from an style tag.
        nested_at_rules: a list of all nested at-rules.
        rulesets: a list of all rulesets.
        comments: a list of all comments in string format.
        color_rulesets: a list of all rulesets that target color or
            background colors.
        selectors: a list of all selectors.
        has_repeat_selectors (bool): whether there are any repeated
            selectors anywhere in the stylesheet (including in the
            NestedAtRule.
        repeated_selectors (list): a list of any selectors that are
            repeated. They might be repeated in the main stylesheet
            or they might be repeated in one of the nested @rules.

    algorithm used by browsers to determine the CSS declaration that
    is the most relevant to an element, which in turn, determines
    the property value to apply to the element.

    The specificity algorithm calculates the weight of a CSS selector
    to determine which rule from competing CSS declarations gets
    applied to an element.

    The specificity score is basically a number, and if two selectors
    target the same element, the selector with the highest specificity
    score wins. The number is like a 3-digit number, where the "ones"
    place is the number of type selectors, the "tens" place is the
    number of class selectors, and the "hundreds" place is the number
    of id selectors.

    For example, the selector: `h1, h2, h3` has a specificity of `003`
    because there are neither id nor class selectors, but there are 3
    type selectors.

    The selector: `nav#main ul` has a specificity of `102` because
