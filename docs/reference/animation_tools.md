## Notes
I added these tools to check CSS animations. In my class, my more advanced students are learning to make keyframe animations, and I want to test to make sure they have a certain number of keyframes, and be able to check whether they are using `from {}` and `to {}` keyframes as well as percentage keyframes.

I would also like to encourage them to animate more than use standard properties, but to target transforms.
