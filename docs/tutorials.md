## Set up
In order to grade student projects, you'll want to create a directory in your root project folder. I title mine "project".

Be sure you have installed and imported webcode-tk (I prefer poetry: `poetry install webcode-tk`)

Place your web documents in the project folder.

In your Python script, set the project folder as a path:
`project_path = "project"`
