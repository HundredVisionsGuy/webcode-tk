# file-clerk Docs

A collection of functions for dealing with files and file content.

This was a library I created for previous projects that deal with files
and file paths in order to get code from files, lists of files in
project folders, file extensions, and allows us to capture just files
of a particular type.

I also developed my projects on Windows OS, so
these functions were designed to work with the file paths on Windows,
Mac, and Linux (Windows is the one with backslashes - wacky, I know.).

## Acknowledgements
I'd like to thank Guido van Rossum for his love of Monty Python and creating the Python programming language (pseudo-code that works) as well as the Python community and PyCon for running Development Sprints and giving rookies like me the chance to learn how to contribute to open-source projects.

I'd also like to thank [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) for being my go-to source for expanding my toolset.

If you can read this, it's because **Real Python** came through yet again by publishing ***[Build Your Python Project Documentation With MkDocs](https://realpython.com/python-project-documentation-with-mkdocs/)***, written by [Martin Breuss](https://realpython.com/python-project-documentation-with-mkdocs/#author) and his trusty team of developers who helped work on the tutorial.
