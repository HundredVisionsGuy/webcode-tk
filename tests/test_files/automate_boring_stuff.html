    <h1>Automate the Boring stuff sample</h1>
    <p>The Python programming language has a wide range of syntactical constructions, standard library functions, and interactive development environment features. Fortunately, you can ignore most of that; you just need to learn enough to write some handy little programs.</p>
    <p>You will, however, have to learn some basic programming concepts before you can do anything. Like a wizard in training, you might think these concepts seem arcane and tedious, but with some knowledge and practice, you’ll be able to command your computer like a magic wand and perform incredible feats.</p>
    <p>This chapter has a few examples that encourage you to type into the interactive shell, also called the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), which lets you run (or execute) Python instructions one at a time and instantly shows you the results. Using the interactive shell is great for learning what basic ython instructions do, so give it a try as you follow along. You’ll remember the things you do much better than the things you only read.</p>
