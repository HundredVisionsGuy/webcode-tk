      <h2>Happy Little Paragraphs</h2>
      <p>From <a href="https://www.bobrosslipsum.com/" title="bobrossipsum">Bob Ross Ipsum</a></p>
      <p>I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. I want everbody to be happy. That's what it's all about. This painting comes right out of your heart.</p>
      <p>Let that brush dance around there and play. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart. All kinds of happy little splashes.</p>
      <p>This is unplanned it really just happens. Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Water's like me. It's laaazyÂ ... Boy, it always looks for the easiest way to do things You got your heavy coat out yet? It's getting colder.</p>
      <p>In this world, everything can be happy. Automatically, all of these beautiful, beautiful things will happen. You need the dark in order to show the light. Look at them little rascals. Brown is such a nice color. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here.</p>
      <p>Isn't that fantastic? Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. You have to make almighty decisions when you're the creator. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. A little happy sunlight shining through there.</p>
      <p>If I paint something, I don't want to have to explain what it is. I spend a lot of time walking around in the woods and talking to trees, and squirrels, and little rabbits and stuff. Let your imagination just wonder around when you're doing these things. The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. Volunteering your time; it pays you and your whole community fantastic dividends. We start with a vision in our heart, and we put it on canvas.</p>
      <p>That's what makes life fun. That you can make these decisions. That you can create the world that you want. It's all a game of angles. That's what painting is all about. It should make you feel good when you paint. We'll make some happy little bushes here.</p>
