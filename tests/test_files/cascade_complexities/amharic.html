            <h2>Origin of the Amharic Script</h2>
            <p>The Amharic script is derived from the ancient **Ge'ez script**, which has been used in Ethiopia for centuries. Originally developed for the Ge'ez language, the script evolved to serve as the primary writing system for Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia.</p>
            <p>Ge'ez is now a liturgical language, but its script forms the basis for several modern Ethiopian languages, including Amharic and Tigrinya.</p>

            <h2>Structure of the Script</h2>
            <p>The Amharic script is an **abugida**, meaning each character represents a consonant combined with a specific vowel. The script consists of a core set of 33 characters, and each character has seven forms that correspond to different vowels.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The vowels are: <strong>ä, u, i, a, e, ə, o</strong>.</li>
                <li>For example, the character <strong>መ</strong> represents the sound "mä," while <strong>ሙ</strong> represents "mu."</li>
                <li>Characters are organized in tables, making it easy to learn and use.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How Amharic Is Written</h2>
            <p>Amharic is written from left to right, similar to English. Each syllable is represented by a distinct character, making the script compact and efficient.</p>
            <p>Traditional manuscripts were written with ink and parchment, but modern texts are typed using specialized keyboards or software that supports the Amharic Unicode standard.</p>
            <p>Below is an example of how a sentence looks in Amharic:</p>
            <blockquote>ኢትዮጵያ ታሪካችንን በጥበብ እና ሥራ ታግሣለች።</blockquote>
