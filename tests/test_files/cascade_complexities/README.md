# Place your project here.
This is where you will put your HTML document.
I recommend you add an `images` folder and place your images inside.
For more details, please read the [One Pager Project Requirements](../README.md).

## HTML Requirements:
* Your one-pager must be named `index.html`
* Must ***use appropriate headers*** according to semantic reasoning
* Must have at least ***three sections each*** labeled ***with an appropriate header***.
    - should be level 2 headings.
    - [optional] sub headings (level 3) are allowed, but only if you are breaking up a section into sub-sections
* Must have (on average) at least two paragraphs per section (for a total of 6 in all).
* Must include at least **2 images**, and every image, should be...
    - inside **a figure** element
    - with **a caption**
    - credits
* Page should include at least **4 links**
* Must have at least **two lists** with on average **3 list items per list**
    - They can be ordered or unordered (your choice)

## CSS Requirements
* Must ***use CSS*** as a style tag or external stylesheet to add styles.
    - ***May NOT use the style attribute***
* ***Font family should be modified*** (not default font)
    - Only 1 font-family is required
    - A font-pairing might be nice
* ***Colors*** (background and foreground) ***must be applied*** to...
    - Headers
    - all remaining tags using a global selector (html or body)
* All color combinations, must meeting **Color Contrast at a Level AAA**
    - Most text must meet **Normal Level AAA**
    - Large text may meet **Large Level AAA**
    - According to the [Color Contrast Checker](), *"Large text is defined as ...**18.66px and bold or larger**, or ...**24px or larger**."*
* All HTML and CSS must pass W3C Validation with no errors.

## Design Requirements:
Note: these requirements will be scored directly by your teacher.
* Above all, ***text must be readable*** (both through the font-face as well as in the use of high contrast colors)
* Use of fonts (no more than 2) and colors match the content of the site.
* All paragraphs of text are broken up into smaller chunks of text and  left-aligned or justified (NOT centered).
* Bullet and numbered lists should also be left-aligned.
* Typography follows most guidelines of the [Practical Typography Summary of Key Rules](https://practicaltypography.com/summary-of-key-rules.html) especially font size, line spacing, and line length.
* Layout is balanced without any irregular gaps that call attention to themselves. Any images should be floated so the text wraps around it.
