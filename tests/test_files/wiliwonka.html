        <h2>PREFACE</h2>
            <p>Homestuck is a webcomic primarily written and illustrated by Andrew Hussie. It ran from April 13, 2009 to April 13, 2016, with <b>8,123 total pages</b>. It was originally hosted on <a href="http://www.mspaintadventures.com/newindex.php">mspaintadventures.com</a>, but is better viewed via the very creative <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/">homestuck.com</a>. It uses multiple mediums, from short gifs to 20-minute long animations to interactive games, complete with a lengthy soundtrack.
                <br><br>
                It's also Really <i>Really <b>Really</b> </i>weird.
                <br><br>
                Homestuck is a story about four 13 year-old kids who play a game that ends the world. A game in which said kids become gods. A game about time travel and multiverses and radioactive omniscient dogs. There's also gray space aliens but they don't even exist at the beginning and skipping right to them misses crucial worldbuilding and tone-setting.
                <br><br>
                In this, I'll just be going over some basics.

                <br>
                <p>Chumhandle: A Pesterchum username. Typically following an “adjectiveNoun” structure. <br>
                Pesterchum: The fictional messaging application utilized by The Kids.<br>
                Text Color: Every character types or “talks” in a specific color.<br>
                Guardian: As in “parent or guardian.”<br>
				Specibus: The kind of weapon a character can wield. For example, bladekind allows you to use swords (and the like).<br>
                Captchalogue Modus: “Captchaloguing” is a cards-based* inventory system. A “modus” determines the rules of how said inventory works. A few modi are based off of computer data structures!<br>
                Sylladex: The name of one's inventory, i.e. “you captchalogue the HAMMER in your SYLLADEX.”<br>
                <br>
                *The amount of items you can store in your inventory is, incredibly, determined by the amount of Captchalogue Cards in your deck/Sylladex.

                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/homestuck_page_00001-john_june_egbert.gif" alt="A young man stands in his bedroom, facing to the right. There is a door behind him decorated with a crooked poster for the Sburb Beta, the videogame that ends the world. To his left is a small cabinet with two drawers. On it are a rolled up poster, a large cake, and a small piece of paper. To his right is a bed."><br>
                        <figcaption>
                            <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story/1">The first panel of Homestuck.</a><br>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Shockingly, John likes Ghostbusters. “<a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story/4">Really Terrible Movies</a>” are kinda his thing.</li>
                        <li>Ditto.</li>
                        <li>Dad Egbert! Honest, hardworking father struggling to connect with his teenage son.</li>
                        <li>Ah the Fetch and Stack moduses. Unequivocally horrible. Fetch utilizes a first-in last-out system, meaning you can only use the last card in your Sylladex; if you want to use a different item, you gotta get rid of that last one first.<br>
                            Stack is the same but using first-in first-out.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3>ROSE</h3>
                        <figure>
                            <img src="images/homestuck_page_00360-rose_lalonde.gif" alt="Rose on a staircase in her living room. She is squinting at a gaudy wizard statue on her left."><br>
                            <figcaption>
                                <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story/360">Rose pondering one of Mom's wizards.</a><br>
                            </figcaption>
                        </figure>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Rose is into scary things like The Eldritch Horrorterrors and psychoanalyzing her friends.</li>
                            <li>A “Squiddle” is a goofy squid-like creature from a TV-show.</li>
                            <li>Mom Lalonde. Absent, but rich. Rose views all of her mother's actions as passive-aggressive. But Mom really does just love wizards!</li>
                            <li>The Tree modus is best explained by example. Say you have 3 items. A LAPTOP, VIOLIN, and GRIMOIRE. The first item you captchalogue will become the "root" card. If the LAPTOP is the root card, and you captchalogue the VIOLIN, it will sort into the right "branch" of the LAPTOP. This is because L > V; it comes first in the alphabet. Likewise, G > L, so the GRIMOIRE is sorted to the left branch. <br><br>
                        </ol>
                            <figure>

                            </figure>
                        <p>(Using the root card will remove all items from your sylladex. Yikes!)</p>
                <h3>DAVE</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/homestuck_page_00321-dave_strider.gif" alt="Dave in his room, by an open closet. There are turntables to his left and a tall floor fan to the right."><br>
                        <figcaption>
                            <a href="https://www.homestuck.com/story/321">Dave captchaloguing some juice from his closet.</a><br>
                        </figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Dave is a Master of Sick Beats. (He has turntables!!)</li>
                        <li>Ditto. Again.</li>
                        <li>Bro Strider. Ninja puppet master. Scourge of Dave's life. <i>You'll never see him coming.</i> </li>
                        <li>Like the Tree modus, the Hashmap modus is based off of the name of the item.
                            Each letter in an item's name is assigned a value;
                            <span class="blue">2</span> for consonants and
                            <span class="red">1</span> for vowels.
                            It then adds up the numbers and divides by the number of cards in the deck. The final value is the remainder.
                            For example, if you wanted to store some SHURIKENS, it would count
                            <span class="blue">S H </span>
                            <span class="red">U </span>
                            <span class="blue">R </span>
                            <span class="red">I </span>
                            <span class="blue">K </span>
                            <span class="red">E </span>
                            <span class="blue">N S </span>
                            = 15. If we have 10 cards, we divide by 10 and get 1.5. The remainder is 5, so the SHURIKENS are stored in the 5th card.</li>
                    </ol>
                <h3>JADE</h3>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/homestuck_page_00799-jade_harley.gif" alt="Jade in her room, by a pile of assorted plushies. There is a spiral staircase on her left, going down, and a purple chest decorated with moons and stars to her right."><br>

                    </figure>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Jade has a garden! Well, a greenhouse, but close enough.</li>
                        <li>The dog is because of Bec (see below), and the atom is because she's a Woman In S.T.E.M.!!! Hehe yeah she does science.</li>
                        <li>Bec, full name Becquerel, is the radioactive dog I mentioned in the beginning. Jade <i>had</i> a Grandpa Harley but he's dead before the story begins.</li>
                        <li>The Memory modus makes you match two cards to retrieve items. Pictionary makes you draw them.</li>

She has gray skin, yellow eyes, short messy black hair, and cat-ear shaped horns that fade from yellow to orange to red. She is wearing a blue hat covering most of her head that has a cat face on it, a black t-shirt with the Leo zodiac symbol on it, a floor-length dark green coat with a collar and pockets, dark gray pants, blue shoes, and a blue cat tail."><br>
