    <h1>CSS Basics (sample)</h1>
    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?</p>
    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
    <p>Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects paragraph text, setting the color to red:</p>
    <p>Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above) into a new file. Save the file as style.css in a directory named styles.</p>
    <p>To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise, the styling won't change the appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project, pause here to read Dealing with files and HTML basics.)</p>
